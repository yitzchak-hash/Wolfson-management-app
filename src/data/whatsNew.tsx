/**
 * The app's own changelog, told as a walkthrough.
 *
 * Every update adds ONE entry here, dated, newest first — the convention is
 * in CLAUDE.md next to the backup rule, because a what's-new that stops being
 * written is worse than none: it tells the office the app stopped moving.
 *
 * An item's `demo` picks one of a few small animated vignettes drawn by the
 * presenter — a tile sliding into a slot, a finger pressing, a pin dropping —
 * because SEEING the gesture is the difference between a changelog and a
 * lesson. No screenshots: they rot the moment the UI moves on.
