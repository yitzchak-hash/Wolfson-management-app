# Wolfson Management App — Developer Notes

## Project Overview
Internal project-management system for TzviAir's HVAC installation across W Residence (buildings A1, A2, A3).
Tracks apartment-level progress through installation stages, contractor assignments, and photo evidence.

## Tech Stack
- **React 19** + **TypeScript** + **Vite 8**
- **Tailwind CSS v3** (dark theme default; light theme toggle stored in localStorage)
- **Zustand v5** for state (auto-persists to localStorage via `persist()`)
- **React Router v6** (nested routes under `AppLayout`)
- **Firebase Firestore** (optional — falls back to localStorage if not configured)
- **date-fns** for date formatting
- **file-saver** for CSV download
- **lucide-react** for icons

## Repository
`yitzchak-hash/wolfson-management-app` — development branch: `claude/blissful-cray-spTFY`

## Deployment
- **Hosting**: Vercel (connected to GitHub repo, auto-deploys on push)
- **Serverless API**: `/api` folder at repo root — Vercel auto-deploys each `.js` file as a serverless function
- **Environment variables**: Set in Vercel dashboard (Firebase config, Google service account, API key)

## Drive Upload Backend (Vercel API routes)
- `/api/drive-session.js` — creates a Google Drive resumable upload session via service account; returns a one-time `uploadUrl` so the browser uploads the file directly to Drive (no bytes pass through Vercel)
- `/api/folder.js` — finds or creates a Drive subfolder by name under a given parent folder ID
- Service account JSON stored as `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` env var in Vercel
- Shared secret stored as `API_KEY` env var — sent as `x-api-key` header from the React app
- Upload flow: Browser → `/api/drive-session` (tiny JSON) → browser streams file directly to Google Drive
- Supports any file size including 500MB+ videos; Vercel never touches the file bytes
- The `backend/` folder in the repo is superseded by these API routes and can be ignored
- **Frontend integration** (`src/data/driveApi.ts`): `isUploadBackendConfigured()` (checks `VITE_DRIVE_API_KEY`), `findOrCreateFolderViaBackend(parentId, name)`, `uploadFileViaBackend(folderId, file, onProgress)` — uploads raw `File` via XHR PUT to the resumable session URL with progress events
- **ContractorPortal upload logic**: if backend configured AND apartment has `driveLink` → stream file to Drive (Photos subfolder), store only `driveFileId`/`driveUrl` + a small image thumbnail (videos/files keep no local bytes); otherwise fall back to local base64 with 50 MB cap
- **MediaItem** handles `driveOnly` files (empty `dataUrl`, has `driveUrl`) by linking out to Drive instead of rendering base64
- `VITE_DRIVE_API_KEY` must equal the backend's `API_KEY`; it lives in the public bundle (deters casual abuse, not a true secret — real protection is the Contributor-only service account)

## Data Model Key Points
- **Building IDs**: `A1`, `A2`, `A3`
- **Apartment numbering per building**: 1-52 (floors 2-14, 4/floor), 53-54 (floor 15, 2 wide), 55-56 (floor 16, 2 wide), basement slots 57+ (unnamed by default)
- **A1 is missing apartment 37** (blank placeholder with `isUnnamed: true`)
- **No duplex apartments** — `isDuplexApt` field retained for data compat but always `false`
- **Classification**: `'standard'` or `'shinui'` (displayed as "Changes" in UI, internal value preserved)
- **mergedWith**: optional field on Apartment for buyer-merged units (bilateral link, managed via `mergeApartments()` action)
- **Merged apartment sync**: `currentStageId`, `classification`, `driveLink`, and `plansPdfLink` auto-sync to the partner on every `updateApartment` call
- **unmergeApartments(aptId, keepDataAptId, user)**: unlinking action; `keepDataAptId` is `aptId | partnerId | 'both'`; the loser gets `currentStageId=null`, `driveLink=undefined`, `plansPdfLink=undefined`
- **driveLink**: Google Drive folder URL for the apartment; stored on Apartment, editable in drawer
- **plansPdfLink**: Google Drive file URL for the Engineering Plans PDF; shown as embedded iframe viewer + download in both admin drawer and contractor portal
- **DATA_VERSION** in `initialData.ts` — bumping forces a localStorage reset (dev only; production data would need a migration)
- **TaskAttachment**: `{ id, filename, mimeType, dataUrl }` — files attached to a task when creating it; `dataUrl` stripped before Firestore writes (stays in localStorage only)

## Contractor Portal
- Public URL: `/c/:token` — no auth required, token-based access
- Contractors have category: `'drywall' | 'ac' | 'general'`
- Each contractor has a unique random token; link is copyable from Settings > Contractors
- Assignments link contractor → apartment with task description, stage, due date
- Two tabs: **My Tasks** (assignment cards with countdown badges) and **Building Map**
- Building map highlights assigned apartments with gold glow; filter buttons: All / Overdue / Today / Tomorrow / This Week
- Each highlighted cell shows a tiny schedule label (Today / Tomorrow / Overdue / date) at cell bottom
- Contractor can upload photos, videos, and files; office notes visible read-only
- **Completed button is disabled until at least one file exists**
- Engineering Plans PDF shown in task detail sheet when `apartment.plansPdfLink` is set
- File storage: images compressed (max 1200px, 72% JPEG), videos/files stored as raw base64 (max 50 MB)
- `ContractorPhoto.fileType`: `'image' | 'video' | 'file'` (default `'image'` for backward compat)

## Backup / Restore
- **Export**: full JSON snapshot of all app data including photos (Settings > App > Backup)
- **Import**: upload JSON to fully restore state
- Version field in export for forward-compat checks
- **Backup frequency**: `'activity' | 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly'` — controls how often auto-snapshots fire
- **Backup history log**: `BackupLogEntry[]` — each export logs filename, size, trigger type, timestamp
- **Drive backup**: `/api/drive-upload.js` + `/api/folder.js` — backup JSON uploaded to Google Drive via service account (no OAuth needed)
- `BackupLogEntry`: `{ id, createdAt, filename, sizeBytes, triggeredBy: 'manual'|'auto', driveUrl? }`

## Key Conventions
- **No DATA_VERSION bump** without explicit need — it wipes all user data
- All store mutations call `persist(get)` + `fsSet(...)`/`fsDelete(...)` for Firebase sync
- Binary fields (`dataUrl` on photos, office files, task attachments) are stripped before Firestore writes; merged back from localStorage on read
- App settings (backupFrequency, backupDriveFolderLink, contractorUiStrings, autoBackup) live in `settings/app` Firestore document
- Loggable fields (those that appear in activity log): `currentStageId`, `classification`, `generalNotes`, `displayName`
- CSS colors: primary `#1e3a5f` (navy), accent `#4aa8d8` (blue), amber for Changes badge
- Always use Tailwind utility classes; only reach for inline `style` for dynamic/computed values
- Contractor token generation: `generateToken()` → 24-char alphanumeric random string
- `getDueBadge(dueDate)` → `{ text, cls }` — shared countdown badge logic (copy used in TasksPage and ContractorPortal)
- **Tooltip component** (`src/components/ui/Tooltip.tsx`): `<Tooltip text="…" side="top|bottom|left|right">`. Uses CSS `group/tip` hover pattern, `z-[200]`, renders nothing when `text` is empty. Applied to all icon-only buttons throughout the app.
- **Always update this CLAUDE.md** when new types, pages, or conventions are added

## Tasks Page
- Route: `/tasks` — requires auth, accessible via sidebar (ClipboardList icon, between Dashboard and Analytics)
- Full CRUD for contractor assignments: create, inline edit, mark complete/incomplete, delete
- Filter by contractor; sorted incomplete-first then by due date
- Countdown badges via `getDueBadge()` for overdue/today/tomorrow/within-3-days tasks
- Task creation supports file attachments (`TaskAttachment[]`) via Paperclip button in `QuickAddTaskPanel`

## ApartmentDetailDrawer
- 4 tabs: **details** / **tasks** / **stages** / **history**
- **Tasks tab**: shows all `ContractorAssignment` records for that apartment; pending badge on tab button; mark complete inline; attachment thumbnails; Add Task button opens `QuickAddTaskPanel`
- `getTaskDueBadge()` helper defined inside component (mirrors `getDueBadge()` logic)

## Settings Page Tabs
- **Stages** — add/edit/reorder/delete stages with color picker
- **Users** — manage admin users (name, code, role)
- **Contractors** — manage contractors, copy portal link, see token
- **App** — theme toggle, backup frequency, backup history log, Drive backup folder, export/import
- **Language** — edit all `ContractorUiStrings` fields (grouped by section), Reset to English / Reset to Hebrew buttons, RTL toggle

## localStorage Persistence
- `persist(get)` in store: tiered save — first attempt keeps photos with Drive URL lean (`dataUrl: ''`); if quota still exceeded, strips ALL binary data and truncates logs
- `saveToStorage()` catches `QuotaExceededError` / `NS_ERROR_DOM_QUOTA_REACHED` and returns `false` so the fallback tier runs
- `activityLogs` capped at 200 in normal save, 50 in fallback; `backupSnapshots` capped at 5 / 0

## Google Drive Integration
- No client-side OAuth — uploads go through service account backend (`/api/drive-session.js`, `/api/folder.js`)
- `googleClientId` / `googleAccessToken` / `googleTokenExpiry` remain in Zustand for backward-compat but are not exposed in UI
- **Helpers in `src/data/driveApi.ts`**:
  - `isUploadBackendConfigured()` — checks `VITE_DRIVE_API_KEY`
  - `extractFolderId(url)` — pull folder ID from any Drive folder URL
  - `extractFileId(url)` — pull file ID from any Drive file/doc URL
  - `drivePreviewUrl(fileId)` → embed URL for iframe PDF viewer
  - `driveDownloadUrl(fileId)` → direct download link
  - `findOrCreateFolderViaBackend(parentId, name)` — finds/creates subfolder via `/api/folder`
  - `uploadFileViaBackend(folderId, file, onProgress)` — streams file to Drive via `/api/drive-session`
  - `checkFolderHealth(driveLink, plansPdfLink, token)` → `FolderHealth` — kept for read-only folder health checks

## Firebase Sync (Full)
All collections are synced to Firestore in real time:
- `apartments`, `stageNotes`, `stages`, `users`, `activityLogs`
- `contractors`, `contractorAssignments`, `contractorNotes`
- `contractorPhotos` (metadata only — `dataUrl` stripped; merged from localStorage on read)
- `officeNoteFiles` (metadata only — `dataUrl` stripped)
- `settings/app` document: `autoBackup`, `backupFrequency`, `backupDriveFolderLink`, `contractorUiStrings`

`startFirebaseSync()` (called on login):
1. Loads all 11 collections in parallel
2. If data exists → merges binary fields from localStorage and sets state
3. If empty → pushes entire localStorage snapshot as first-run seed
4. Attaches real-time listeners on all collections

`fsDelete(collectionName, docId)` added to `firebase.ts` — used by `deleteContractor`, `deleteContractorAssignment`, `deleteContractorPhoto`, `deleteOfficeNoteFile`, and cascade deletes.

**Setup**: copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in `VITE_FIREBASE_*` vars (or set in Vercel dashboard)
